Game Title: The Last Bus-Home 

Concept Summary:

"The Last Bus Home" is a slice-of-life interactive narrative game that explores how small, 
everyday decisions can profoundly impact human connections. Players take on the role 
of a commuter on the final bus ride home, where chance encounters with fellow 
passengers present opportunities for connection, kindness, or solitude. Through simple 
but meaningful choices, players discover how their approach to strangers shapes not 
only their journey but potentially their life beyond the bus ride. 

The game embodies the competition theme "Decisions That Define Us" by 
demonstrating that our character is revealed not in grand gestures, but in how we treat 
strangers during mundane moments. Each playthrough lasts 10-15 minutes and offers 
six distinct endings based on whether players prioritize kindness, practicality, or personal 
boundaries.
